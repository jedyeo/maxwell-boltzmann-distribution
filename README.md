When observing some non-trivial quantity of gas, it is impossible to measure the exact velocity of each
molecule at every instant. The probability density as expressed on the y-axis of each graph represents
how many molecules are moving between two different speeds.

Calculate numerically the rms velocities for 20 C air and helium and find from these values the speed of
sound in these gases.

v_rms of air is 502.13271686306155
speed of sound in air at 293.15 K is 343.0164739182512
v_rms of He2 is 1352.0337176808966
speed of sound in He2 at 293.15 K is 1005.7128698092711
